# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
I must admit, I had a real hard time with OOP. It definitely stretched me and eventually put me in a position that I reached out to Kaitlyn for help as I could feel myself panicking. I was challenged to the max, but was able to resource to help through the adversity.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
My workflow is constantly disrupted by things taking longer than anticipated. I am used to pivoting through challenges, but have been more flustered today than in recent memory.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need? I believe at this point it will be helpful for me to get a better understanding of the basic tools. You cant build a house if you dont understand how to work a hammer with a nail, so I would like to spend time over the next few weeks working on random coding exercises as well as reading up on Ruby to get a better feel for programming in general.
